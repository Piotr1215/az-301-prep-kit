## Design a data management strategy

- [x] __choose between managed and unmanaged data store__

  - Unmanaged Data Stores (choose when need high performance tuning or hight degree of control over hosting environment and offering)
    - Table
    - Blob
    - File
    - Queue
    - SQL Server in VM
    - Orable DB in VM

  - Managed Data Stores (highly available, auto-scaling, threat detection, auto tuning)
    - VM Data Disk
    - Azure SQL Database
    - Cosmos DB
    - Azure Database for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
    - Managed SQL Server

    - **RPO** stands for recovery POINT objective, i.e., how much data is one potentially prepared and willing to lose, worse case
    - **RTO** stands for recovery TIME objective, i.e., if/when the ‘bad thing’ happens, how much time does it take to be back up and running again

- [x] __design a data warehouse strategy__

  - Use when need to do reports and analytics

  - Read only data

  - Use [Azure Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/) to combine data from different sources and perform ad hoc analysis

  - [Big Data Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/big-data)

## Design a data protection strategy

- [x] __recommend geographic data storage__

||LRS|ZRS|GRS|RA-GRS|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Overview|Replicates data in a single datacenter|Stores copies of data across multiple datacenters|Stores copies in a local datacenter, like LRS, but then stores three more copies in a datacenter in another region|Same as GRS, but offers read access in the secondary datacenter in the other region|
|Data copies|3|3|6|6|
|Use case|Ensures that your data is highly available but, for compliance reasons, must be kept local|A higher durability option for block storage, where data can stay in only one region|Where you need to ensure that your data and systems are always available despite datacenter or region outages|Where your applications (especially those with many read requests) can read data from other regions, but also to ensure that read operations are always available even if the primary region is down|
